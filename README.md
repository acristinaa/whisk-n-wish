A Sims-inspired personal recipe website  

## Overview  
This is a simple website where I collect and share my favorite recipes. It is styled with a playful nod to *The Sims* — because who wouldn’t love to just type:  

stats.set_skill_level major_cooking 10


...and instantly become a master chef?  

The project was created for my SE_19 class at CODE University and is a recipe collection.

## Pages  
- **Home (`index.html`)** → Welcome page with navigation.  
- **About (`about.html`)** → A short intro about me and the purpose of the project.  
- **Seasonal Recipes**  
  - `fall-recipes.html`
  - `winter-recipes.html`
  - `spring-recipes.html`
  - `summer-recipes.html` 

Each seasonal page displays recipes in styled `<div>` cards, giving it a cookbook-like feel.
